# AI_Vampire_vs_Werewolves

The goal of this project is to develop an Artificial Intelligence to play the Vampire vs Werewolves game, according to the set of pre-defined rules. Before delving into the details of our AI, we would like to mention the main ideas we have tried to implement throughout this project. Some of the key steps we wanted to take were:

- communicate effectively with the server and play within 2 seconds no matter what 
- use minimax with alpha beta pruning 
- fine tune the heuristic. Take into consideration enemies, eatable humans, random battles, distances... 
- create a SmartScan that would give us long term thinking and restrict the number of possible moves (only interesting moves) 
- find ways to store some results and win computation time 
- test on many different maps to make sure our player is robust. As a result, no bug was encountered during the competition which is a great achievement.
